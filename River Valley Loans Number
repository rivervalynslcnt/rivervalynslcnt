River Valley Loans Number

Given that it’s back-to-school season, I did some digging into the private schools near me and contacted financial aid offices to get a deeper scope into cost to see what kind of financial aid is offered.

As a former student loans reporter, what I found was surprising. While most of them boast tuition costs higher than the cost of a semester of my college education, there doesn’t seem to be a universal financing option for K-12 like there is for private college students.

Unlike college, private K-12 education isn’t financeable through federal or private student loans. Rather, financial aid can be offered through state grants or through each school’s financial aid office. These funds are typically donor-based and offered to those who qualify. Others may offer payment plans or reduced tuition programs, although those options are also dependent on the school.

While these options may help initially, if the financial aid falls short or you find yourself needing an extra boost to make the monthly payments, then it may be necessary to look into financing the remaining costs.
