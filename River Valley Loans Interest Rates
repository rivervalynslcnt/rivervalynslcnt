River Valley Loans Interest Rates

Once you’ve exhausted all of your scholarship and grant options, then you’ll want to consider financing your child’s education. Before turning to a loan, look into a 0 percent APR credit card, which offers an introductory 0 percent interest period, typically for around 12-24 months.

However, this is only a good idea if you can feasibly pay off the entire balance within the 0 percent period. Otherwise, you’ll end up paying a much higher interest rate than you likely would with a loan.

If you’ve decided to go the route of a loan, prequalify with as many personal loan lenders as possible before applying. Prequalifying allows you to check your predicted rate before applying with no impact to your credit score. From there, you can more easily compare lenders to find the one that meets your needs and offers the best rate.
